Welcome!

My name is Qinyue Luo. I am an assistant professor at the Center For Intelligence Economic Science at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

My research research interested are concentrated in the fields of labor economics, the economics of education and development economics. My completed research falls into two areas. One set of work tries to understand factors that exacerbate inequality and hinder the education attainments or labor market performance of disadvantaged social groups, such as females, non-locals, and older workers. Another set of studies focus on how skills are valued over time and across regions, the response of skill demand to technology development and policy shocks, as well as job seekersâ€™ adjustments to change in skill demand in the labor market.
